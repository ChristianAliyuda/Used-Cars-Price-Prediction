# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
# Understanding the problem statement and business case
* In this hand-on project, we will train 3 Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost to predict the price of used cars.
* INPUTS(FEATURES): Make, Model, Type, Origin, Drivetrain, Invoice, EngineSize, Cylinders, Horesepower, MPG_City, MPG_Highway, Weight, Wheelbase and Lenght.
* OUTPUT: MSRP (price)
* This project can be used by car dealerships to predict used car prices and understand key factors that contribute to used car prices.
